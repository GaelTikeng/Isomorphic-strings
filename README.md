# Isomorphic string app
## About
This is an app that takes two strings and check if theyare isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if one-to-one mapping is possible for every characters of the first string to every characters of the second string.
## How it works
Input the two strings you want to check if they are isomorphic or not then click on "check" button. If the two strings are of different length it returns "The two strings must be the same" else will display true or false.
